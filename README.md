Project Description
This is an application to help delivery shop owners find the least-cost way to deliver packages. The program gives the user:

Complete GUI for ease of use
Complete database to save the information at any time
A choice of the algorithm to use: either GA (Genetic Algorithm) or SA (Simulated Annealing)
A percentage setting for how much to focus on package priority, where zero is the least
Problem Formulation
State:
A state represents which packages are assigned to each vehicle.
It is stored as a dictionary in the following format:

State = { V1: [P1, P2], V2: [P3, P4], ..., Vn: [Pn] }
Where:

Vn is a vehicle
[Pn] is the list of packages assigned to that vehicle
Objective Function:
The objective function evaluates how optimal a state is. The goal is to minimize this function.
It considers two main factors:

Distance – lower total distance results in lower cost
Priority – packages with higher priority (1 is highest) should be delivered earlier
Cost = Σ [ W1 × DirectCost + W2 × (1 / Priority) × PathCost ]
Where:

W1, W2 are user-defined weights
DirectCost is the straight-line cost
Priority is the priority value (1 is highest)
PathCost is the path length or cost
Algorighims Used
Simmulated Annealing - SA
Where the next state were generated as the following:
Next State The next state is generated randomly at each iteration by choosing one of the following methods:

Switching packages within the same vehicle – two random packages from a randomly selected vehicle are swapped. This introduces variation in the route. No weight check is needed in this case.
Swapping packages between two different vehicles – two random packages from two different vehicles are swapped. A weight constraint check is required.
Moving a package from one vehicle to another – one random package is moved from a source vehicle to a different target vehicle. A weight constraint check is required.
Genetic Algorithm - GA
Chromosome (State):
A complete assignment of packages to vehicles. Each vehicle has its own route to deliver the assigned packages.

Population:
A set of 100 randomly generated chromosomes.

Crossover:

Two parent chromosomes are selected.
A number of vehicles are randomly chosen from both parents.
For a fixed number of rounds (e.g., 5), randomly select a vehicle from each parent and swap their packages.
Remove duplicate packages and reconstruct the routes.
Mutation:

Some offspring are randomly selected for mutation.
Mutation involves changing the tour (delivery route) of a randomly selected vehicle within the chromosome.
